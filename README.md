emacs-freex
===========

Emacs Freex mode is a minor mode for organizing and editing a massively-hyperlinked database of your notes and ideas. It's a personal wiki on steroids.

For a more detailed description, read the [Introduction].

You can grab the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/emacs-freex/downloads/list Downloads page] - freex-x.x.x.tar.gz.

Make sure to read the [Installation] instructions though.

If you learn best by seeing, watch the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGqaSzD-FTE intro screencast].

If you learn best by doing, then you might want to skip to the [Quickstart] or [Tutorial], and try working through things yourself.

The Freex codebase has been pretty stable since about 2007, though we continue to make minor tweaks to improve the interface and make it easier to install. Moved from https://code.google.com/p/emacs-freex/ on 1st July 2015.
